## Requirements

- Node.js v22+

- Discord bot token (see Discord Developer Portal)
- OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purinton/cassandra.git
   cd cassandra
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Discord app token, OpenAI API key, and MySQL credentials.
   - Edit `package.json` (name, description, author, etc.)
   - Update this `README.md` as needed.

3. **Start the app locally:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   node cassandra.mjs
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration is handled via environment variables in the `.env` file. See `.env.example` for required and optional variables. Key variables include:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`: MySQL connection details

## Running as a Service (systemd)

1. Copy `cassandra.service` to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cassandra.service`.
2. Edit the paths and user/group as needed.
3. Reload systemd and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable cassandra
   sudo systemctl start cassandra
   sudo systemctl status cassandra
   ```

## Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t cassandra .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env cassandra
   ```

## Customization

### Commands

- Add new commands in the `commands/` directory.
- Each command has a `.json` definition (for Discord registration/localization) and a `.mjs` handler (for logic).
- **Example:** To add a `/roll` command:
  1. Create `commands/roll.json` for the command definition.
  2. Create `commands/roll.mjs` for the handler logic.
  3. Restart the bot to auto-register the new command.

### Events

- Add or modify event handlers in the `events/` directory.
- Each Discord event (e.g., `ready`, `messageCreate`, `interactionCreate`) has its own handler file.

### Locales

- Add or update language files in the `locales/` directory.
- Localize command names, descriptions, and app responses. All 30+ Discord-supported languages are included and tested for completeness.

## Testing

- Run tests with:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Tests cover:
  - Command and event handler exports
  - Locale file completeness and validity
  - OpenAI prompt logic and error handling
- Add your tests in the `tests/` folder or alongside your code.
